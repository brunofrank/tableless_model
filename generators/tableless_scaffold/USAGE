Description:
    Tableless scaffolds an entire resource, from model, controller and
    views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'tableless_scaffold contact name:string telephone:string firm:string email:string message:text'
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handle
    the create, form to create your contacts, as well as a map.resources :contacts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'script/destroy tableless_scaffold ModelName'.

Examples:
    `./script/generate tableless_scaffold invite`
    `./script/generate tableless_scaffold contact name:string telephone:string firm:string email:string message:text`
