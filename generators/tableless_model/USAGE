Description:
    Stubs out a new tableless model. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

    This generates a model class in app/models, a unit test in test/unit,
    a test fixture in test/fixtures/singular_name.yml.

Examples:
    `./script/generate tableless_model contact`

        creates an Contact model, test, and fixture:
            Model:      app/models/contact.rb
            Test:       test/unit/contact_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/contacts.yml

    `./script/generate tableless_model invite name:string body:text email:string`

        creates a Invite model with a string name, text body, and string email.
